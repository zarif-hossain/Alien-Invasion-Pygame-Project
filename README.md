### Getting Started on Windows

First upgrade pip (optional but recommended) with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

Then to install pygame run `pip install pygame`

### Getting Started on Linux Mint

Linux Mint (like Ubuntu and Debian) now protects the system Python to avoid breaking the OS by discouraging pip3 install globally.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv pygame-env      # create a viritual environment with name ___
source pygame-env/bin/activate  # activate virtual environment
```

Then install pygame using:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

To **deactivate** the virtual environment, run:

```bash
deactivate
```
